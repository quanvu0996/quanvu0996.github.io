excerpt: "Purpose: This study explores non-pharmacological interventions aimed at improving sleep quality and reducing anxiety, focusing on the use of Baloo weighted blankets, both alone and in combination with Frenz auditory cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-i), as alternatives to medication for sleep disorders such as insomnia, poor sleep recovery, and anxiety-related disturbances. Methodology: Forty-five healthy adults participated in the study, experiencing sleep conditions with and without weighted blankets and auditory CBT-i. Key metrics, including sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, deep sleep duration, heart rate, and mood, were assessed. Findings: The results reveal that weighted blankets, such as Baloo, used alone or in combination with CBT-i, can improve sleep quality, morning mood, and readiness to work."
